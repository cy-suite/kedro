# Amazon SageMaker

## Why would you use Amazon SageMaker?

Machine learning development is a complex, expensive, and labour-intensive process with very specific requirements for the execution environment (ML tools and libraries, hardware requirements for CPU or GPU-optimised algorithms). 

Amazon SageMaker provides the components used for machine learning in a single toolset so models get to production faster with much less effort and at lower cost. Amazon SageMaker supports both classical machine learning libraries like [`Scikit-Learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/) or [`XGBoost`](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/), and Deep Learning frameworks such as [`TensorFlow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/) or [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org/).

Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service and its features are covered by the [official service documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/index.html). 

## The `kedro-sagemaker` plugin

The `kedro-sagemaker` plugin enables you to run a Kedro pipeline on Amazon Sagemaker. Consult the [GitHub repository for `kedro-sagemaker`](https://github.com/getindata/kedro-sagemaker) for further details, or take a look at the [documentation](https://kedro-sagemaker.readthedocs.io/).
