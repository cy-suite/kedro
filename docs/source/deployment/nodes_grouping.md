# Node Grouping in Kedro: Pipelines, Tags, and Namespaces

When deploying a **Kedro** project, grouping nodes effectively is crucial for **maintainability, debugging, and execution control**. This document provides an overview of three key grouping methods: **Pipelines, Tags, and Namespaces**, along with a comparison of their strengths, limitations, best use cases, and links to how to use them.

## Comparison Table

| Method      | What Works with Kedro | What Doesn't Work with Kedro | Best Used When | Not to Use When | How to Implement |
|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| Pipelines | - If your project contains multiple pipelines, you can use them as predefined node groupings for deployment. Simply execute each pipeline separately in the deployment environment. | - If you need to create custom node groupings that donâ€™t align with your existing pipelines, creating new pipelines for them may not be convenient. Instead, you can use alternative grouping methods such as tags or covert the pipelines to using namespaces. <br> - You cannot execute multiple pipelines in a single step because kedro only runs one pipeline at a time. <br> - You cannot visualise multiple pipelines in a single plot. | - When your project is already structured in a way that only requires executing your pipelines separately in the deployment environment. | - When you need to run multiple pipelines together <br> - When you need to use kedro-viz | - Run by kedro run --pipeline=<your pipeline name> <br> - More information: [Run a pipeline by name]() |
| Tags | - You can tag individual nodes or the entire pipeline, allowing for flexible execution of specific sections without modifying the pipeline structure (e.g., no need to define a new pipeline). <br> - Kedro-Viz provides a clear visualization of tagged nodes, making it easier to understand. <br> ![Filters Panel in Kedro Viz](../meta/images/kedro_viz_filters_tags.png) | - Nodes with the same tag can exist in different pipelines, making debugging and maintaining the codebase more challenging. <br> - Executing multiple tags in a single step isn't always possible, and sometimes it's not guaranteed to run if a part of the pipeline is not populated before the time of execution. | - If you need to run specific nodes that donâ€™t belong to the same pipeline, you can tag them and execute them together. e.g., Some preprocessing nodes exist in different pipelines, but you need to deploy/run only ingestion-related steps. <br> - If your pipeline is large, but only a subset of nodes needs rerunning, you can tag those nodes and execute them alone. e.g., You have a full ML pipeline (dataprocessing â†’ featureengineering â†’ model_training), but new data arrives daily, and only the feature engineering needs to be redeployed/rerun. | - When the tagged nodes have strong dependencies, or nodes are tagged without considering dependencies, some nodes might not execute properly. <br> - Tags are not inherently hierarchical like pipelines or namespaces. If multiple developers assign tags arbitrarily, it becomes hard to track which nodes belong together. <br> - Tags do not enforce structure; they are just labels. If a developer joins the project, they wonâ€™t immediately understand which nodes are critical for different deployments. | - Run by kedro run --tags=<your tag name> <br> - More information: [How to tag a node]() |
| Namespaces | - Namespaces allow you to group nodes, ensuring clear dependencies and separation within a pipeline while maintaining a consistent structure. <br> - Similar to pipelines or tags, you can enable selective execution using namespaces. <br> - Using namespaces allows you to visualize your grouped nodes through kedro-viz. <br> ![Switching between different namespaces in Kedro Viz](../meta/images/kedro_viz_switching_namespace.png)| - You cannot run multiple namespaces simultaneouslyâ€”Kedro only allows executing one namespace at a time. <br> - Defining namespace at Node-level: If you define namespaces at the node level, they behave similarly to tags and do not guarantee execution consistency. This level of safety is only ensured when using namespaces at the pipeline level. <br> - Defining namespace at Pipeline-level: When applying a namespace at the pipeline level, Kedro automatically renames all inputs, outputs, and parameters within that pipeline. While this helps with modularization, it can introduce unintended naming conflicts if the pipeline is connected elsewhere or if parameters are referenced outside the pipeline. | - Namespaces are ideal for organizing pipelines and allow you to run only part of a pipeline. <br> - If your pipeline structure is well-defined, converting it into namespaces unlocks better visualization in Kedro-Viz, making it easier to explore and understand your nodes grouping. <br> - Customizing Deployment Groups: If you want to group nodes differently or add additional groups of nodes, adding namespaces at the node level helps. Similar to tags, but unlike tags (which only filter nodes in Kedro-Viz), namespaces allow separate visual representation of grouped nodes. | - Increased complexity: <br> - If your pipeline has only a few nodes, adding namespaces may introduce unnecessary complexity without significant benefits. <br> - Applying namespaces at the pipeline level can make the structure harder to manage, with all the names changing as explained in the column of "What doesn't work with Kedro". | - Run by kedro run --namespace=<your namespace name> <br> - More information: [Namespaces]() |


## **Choosing the Right Grouping Method**

If you're unsure which method to use, consider these questions:

- **Do you need ...** â†’ Use **Pipelines**
- **Do you need ...** â†’ Use **Tags**
- **Do you need ...** â†’ Use **Namespaces**

By choosing the right method, you can optimize your Kedro project for **scalability, readability, and efficient deployment.** ðŸš€
