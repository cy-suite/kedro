# Node Grouping in Kedro: Pipelines, Tags, and Namespaces

When deploying a **Kedro** project, grouping nodes effectively is crucial for **maintainability, debugging, and execution control**. This document provides an overview of three key grouping methods: **Pipelines, Tags, and Namespaces**, along with a comparison of their strengths, limitations, best use cases, and links to how to use them.

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | Pipelines | Tags | Namespaces|
|--------|-----------|------|-----------|
| What Works with Kedro | - If your project contains multiple pipelines, you can use them as predefined node groupings for deployment. Simply execute each pipeline separately in the deployment environment.| - You can tag individual nodes or the entire pipeline, allowing for flexible execution of specific sections without modifying the pipeline structure. <br> - Kedro-Viz provides a clear visualization of tagged nodes, making it easier to understand. <br>![Filters Panel in Kedro Viz](../meta/images/kedro_viz_filters_tags.png) | - Namespaces allow you to group nodes, ensuring clear dependencies and separation within a pipeline while maintaining a consistent structure. <br> - Similar to pipelines or tags, you can enable selective execution using namespaces. <br> - Using namespaces allows you to visualize your grouped nodes through kedro-viz. <br> ![Switching between different namespaces in Kedro Viz](../meta/images/kedro_viz_switching_namespace.png) |
| What Doesn't Work with Kedro | - If you need to create custom node groupings that don’t align with your existing pipelines, creating new pipelines for them may not be convenient. <br> - You cannot execute multiple pipelines in a single step because Kedro only runs one pipeline at a time. <br> - You cannot visualize multiple pipelines in a single plot. | - Nodes with the same tag can exist in different pipelines, making debugging and maintaining the codebase more challenging. <br> - Executing multiple tags in a single step isn't always possible, and sometimes it's not guaranteed to run if a part of the pipeline is not populated before the time of execution. | - You cannot run multiple namespaces simultaneously—Kedro only allows executing one namespace at a time. <br> - Defining namespace at Node-level: If you define namespaces at the node level, they behave similarly to tags and do not guarantee execution consistency. <br> - Defining namespace at Pipeline-level: When applying a namespace at the pipeline level, Kedro automatically renames all inputs, outputs, and parameters within that pipeline. This can introduce naming conflicts. |
| Best Used When | - When your project is already structured in a way that only requires executing your pipelines separately in the deployment environment.                                                                                                             | - If you need to run specific nodes that don’t belong to the same pipeline, you can tag them and execute them together. <br> - If your pipeline is large, but only a subset of nodes needs rerunning, you can tag those nodes and execute them alone.                                                                                  | - Namespaces are ideal for organizing pipelines and allow you to run only part of a pipeline. <br> - If your pipeline structure is well-defined, converting it into namespaces unlocks better visualization in Kedro-Viz, making it easier to explore and understand your nodes grouping. <br> - Customizing Deployment Groups by adding namespaces at the node level helps. |
| Not to Use When | - When you need to run multiple pipelines together. <br> - When you need to use kedro-viz.                                                                                                                                                            | - When the tagged nodes have strong dependencies, or nodes are tagged without considering dependencies, some nodes might not execute properly. <br> - Tags are not inherently hierarchical like pipelines or namespaces. If multiple developers assign tags arbitrarily, it becomes hard to track which nodes belong together. <br> - Tags do not enforce structure. | - Increased complexity: <br> - If your pipeline has only a few nodes, adding namespaces may introduce unnecessary complexity without significant benefits. <br> - Applying namespaces at the pipeline level can make the structure harder to manage, with all the names changing.                                                                                                         |

## **Choosing the Right Grouping Method**

If you're unsure which method to use, consider these questions:

- **Do you need ...** → Use **Pipelines**
- **Do you need ...** → Use **Tags**
- **Do you need ...** → Use **Namespaces**
