# Linting

## Introduction
Linting tools are used to improve the quality of your code by checking for errors and making sure it meets a stylistic
standard before it is run. As a project grows and goes through various stages of development, it becomes important to
maintain the code quality. Linting makes your code more readable, easy to debug and maintain, and stylistically
consistent.

## Set up linting tools
There are a variety of linting tools available to use with your Kedro projects. This guide shows you how to use
[`black`](https://github.com/psf/black), [`flake8`](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8), and
[`isort`](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort) to lint your Kedro projects.
- **`black`** is a [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) compliant opinionated Python code formatter. `black` can
check for styling inconsistencies and reformat your files in place.
[You can read more in the `black` documentation](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- **`flake8`** is a wrapper around [`pep8`](https://pypi.org/project/pep8/),
[`pyflakes`](https://pypi.org/project/pyflakes/), and [`mccabe`](https://pypi.org/project/mccabe/) which can flag
programming errors and coding style inconsistencies with respect to [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/),
and check the cyclomatic complexity of your code base.
[You can read more in the `flake8` documentation](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/).
- **`isort`** is a Python library used to sort imports alphabetically and automatically separate them into sections by
type. [You can read more in the `isort` documentation](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/).

### Install linting tools
You can install `black`, `flake8`, and `isort` by adding the following lines to your project's `src/requirements.txt`
file:
```text
black # Used for formatting code
flake8 # Used for linting code
isort # Used for linting code
```
To install all the project-specific dependencies, including the linting tools, navigate to the root directory of the
project and run:
```bash
pip install -r src/requirements.txt
```
Alternatively, you can individually install the linting tools using the following shell commands:
```bash
pip install black
pip install flake8
pip install isort
```

### Run linting tools
Use the following commands to run lint checks:
```bash
black --check <project_root>
flake8 <project_root>
isort --profile black --check <project_root>
```
You can also have `black` and `isort` automatically format your code by omitting the `--check` flag. Since `isort` and
`black` both format your imports, adding `--profile black` to the `isort` run helps avoid potential conflicts.

## Automating linting with `pre-commit` hooks

You can automate linting by using [`pre-commit`](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) hooks.
These hooks are run before committing your code to your repositories to automatically point out formatting issues,
making code reviews easier and less time-consuming.

### Install `pre-commit`
You can install `pre-commit` along with other dependencies by including it in the `src/requirements.txt` file of your
Kedro project by adding the following line:
```text
pre-commit
```
You can also install `pre-commit` using the following command:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
```
### Add `pre-commit` configuration file
Create a file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in your Kedro project root directory. You can add entries for the hooks
you want to run before each `commit`.
Below is a sample `YAML` file with entries for `black`,`flake8`, and `isort`:
```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort
    rev: 5.10.1
    hooks:
      - id: isort
        name: isort (python)
        args: ["--profile", "black"]

  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: ''  # pick a git hash / tag to point to
    hooks:
      - id: flake8

  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 22.8.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
        language_version: python3.9
```
### Install git hook scripts
Run the following command to complete installation:
```bash
pre-commit install
```
This enables `pre-commit` hooks to run automatically every time you execute `git commit`.
