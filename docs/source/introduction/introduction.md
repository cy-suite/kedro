# What is Kedro?

Kedro is an open-source Python framework to create reproducible, maintainable and modular data science code. It borrows concepts from software engineering and applies them to data science projects to help you build production-ready data pipelines that follow best practices for modularity, separation of concerns and versioning. 

Kedro is hosted by the [LF AI & Data Foundation](https://lfaidata.foundation/).

For the source code, take a look at the [Kedro repository on Github](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro).

## Learn how to use Kedro

In the next few chapters, you will learn how to [install Kedro](../get_started/prerequisites.md) and learn some of the key [Kedro concepts](../get_started/kedro_concepts.md).

- The first project you create illustrates the basics of the [Kedro project template](../get_started/example_project.md) using the Iris dataset
- You can then review the [spaceflights tutorial](../tutorial/tutorial_template.md) for a hands-on experience at building a project with Kedro.

We also recommend the [glossary](../resources/glossary.md) and the [API reference documentation](/kedro) for additional information.

## Assumptions

We have designed the documentation and the [spaceflights tutorial](../tutorial/spaceflights_tutorial.md) for anyone new to Kedro. The more knowledge of Python you have, the easier you will find the learning curve.

```{note}
There are a number of excellent online resources for learning Python, but you should choose those that reference Python 3, as Kedro is built for Python 3.7+. There are many curated lists of online resources, such as the [official Python programming language website](https://www.python.org/) and [this list of free programming books and tutorials](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books-langs.md#python).
