# Kedro for notebook users


If you are familiar with notebooks, you probably find their liberal development environment perfect for exploratory data analysis and experimentation.

As project complexity increases, particularly if you work collaboratively, you may decide to transition to Kedro's way of working to organise your code into a shareable project. There is no single way to switch between notebooks and Kedro. It's possible to pair both ways of working and gradually introduce Kedro techniques into your notebook code.

**Add a notebook to your existing Kedro project**
The page titled [Use a Jupyter notebook for Kedro project experiments](./kedro_and_notebooks.md) describes how to set up a notebook to access the elements of a Kedro project for experimentation. If you have an existing Kedro project but want to use notebook features to explore your data and experiment with pipelines, this is the page to start.
