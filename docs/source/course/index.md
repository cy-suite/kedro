# Learn Kedro with hands-on video

If you prefer to learn by following a video tutorial, you can follow the hands-on video course about Kedro

The course is structured into sections, which are further divided in short videos covering a specific Kedro topics. You'll walk through the [spaceflights tutorial](../tutorial/spaceflights_tutorial.md) to get hands-on with that example and rapidly pick up key Kedro concepts.

## Who is this course for?

This course is for data scientists, data engineers and machine learning engineers. You can be junior, mid-level or senior in your field of work. You're likely to be hands-on with projects, or a decision-maker who regularly makes design and implementation choices about Python data products.

We assume you know these concepts:
* Python basics (coding on Jupyter and other notebook interfaces)
* Manipulating data with pandas
* Visualising insights
* Command line basics

We don't assume knowledge of software engineering in Python, so the course contains information about reusability principles, how to create a Python package, and how to use version control.

## What you'll learn

In short, you'll learn how create maintainable, reusable data science code.
