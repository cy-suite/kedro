# Introduction

## What is Kedro?

Kedro is an open source development workflow framework that implements software engineering best-practice for data pipelines with an eye towards productionising machine learning models.

You can use Kedro with a wide range of projects, from organising a single user project running on a local environment, up to enterprise-level collaborative projects that need to optimise the process of taking a machine learning model into a production environment.

For the source code, take a look at the [Kedro repository on Github](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro).

## Learning about Kedro

In the next few chapters, you will learn how to [install](../02_getting_started/01_prerequisites.md) and set up Kedro to build your own production-ready data pipelines.

Once you are set up, to get a feel for Kedro, we suggest working through our examples, including:

-   An entry-level description of the main concepts in ["Hello Kedro"](../02_getting_started/04_hello_kedro.md)
<!-- -   TODO A first [example using the familiar Iris dataset](../02_getting_started/05_example_project.md) to introduce the Kedro project template-->
-   A more detailed [tutorial](../03_tutorial/02_tutorial_template.md) to give you hands-on experience as you learn about Kedro

Advanced users looking for in-depth information should consult the [User Guide](../04_user_guide/03_configuration.md).

You can also check out the resources section for answers to [frequently asked questions](../06_resources/01_faq.md) and the [API reference documentation](/kedro.rst) to find further information.

## Assumptions

We have designed the documentation in general, and the tutorial in particular, for beginners. Our goal is to help you get started and create your own Kedro projects in Python. If you have elementary knowledge of Python then you might find the Kedro learning curve more of a challenge.  However, we have simplified the tutorial to provide all the Python functions required to create the necessary data pipelines.

> *Note:* There are a number of excellent online resources for learning Python, but be aware that you should choose those that reference Python 3, as Kedro is built for Python 3.6+. There are many curated lists of online resources, such as:
