# New project tools (title TBD)
As you saw from the [First steps](../get_started/new_project.md) section, once you have [set up Kedro](../get_started/install.md), you can use `kedro new` to create a basic Kedro project containing project directories and basic code, which you can configure depending on the tooling and example code you need.

There are options to the code you include when you create a new Kedro project, which the pages in this section describe in detail.

**Use `kedro new` to create a basic project** <br />
In the simplest instance, you can create a project using `kedro new` and select from a range of [tools and example code options](./new_project_tools.md) to extend the basic project.

**Use `kedro new` with `--config`** <br />
Similarly, you can use `kedro new` but additionally pass in a configuration file, for example:

```bash
kedro new --config=config.yml
```

The file enables you to customise details such as the project folder name and package name.

The configuration file must contain:

* `output_dir` The path in which to create the project directory, which can be set to `~` for the home directory or `.` for the current working directory
* `project_name`
* `repo_name`
* `python_package`
* TO DO -- tools and example code options

The `output_dir` can be specified as `~` for the home directory or `.` for the current working directory. Here is an example `config.yml`, which assumes that a directory named `~/code` already exists:

```yaml
output_dir: ~/code
project_name: My First Kedro Project
repo_name: testing-kedro
python_package: test_kedro
```
**Use `kedro new` with a `--starter`** <br />
Alternatively, you can create a new Kedro project with a [starter](./starters.md) that adds a set of code for a common project use case.
