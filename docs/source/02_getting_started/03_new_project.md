# Create a new project

Once you have [installed Kedro](./02_install.md), you can create a new project by answering a series of questions, or by using settings recorded in a configuration file.

## Create a new project interactively

Create a new project in your current working directory:

```bash
kedro new
```

You will be asked to enter each of the following variables in turn. Once you have entered text for the first option (the project's name), you will be offered a default choice for the other options:

| Option            | Example           | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project_name`    | `Getting Started` | A human-readable name for your new project                                                                                                                           |
| `repo_name`       | `getting-started` | Directory that holds your project repository                                                                                                                         |
| `python_package`  | `getting_started` | A name for the Python package name in your project (short, all-lowercase)                                                                                            |
| `include_example` | `Y`/`n`           | Confirms or rejects the inclusion of [example code](../02_getting_started/04_hello_kedro.md). If you enter `Y` , your new project template contains a small example. |

The output lists the directory in which to find the project.

### Initialise a `git` repository

Having created your new project, if you are using `git`, you may want to set up a new repository by calling:

```bash
git init
```

## Create a new project from a configuration file

You can create a new project from a configuration file if you prefer. The file must contain:

-   `project_name`
-   `repo_name`
-   `python_package`
-   `include_example` (Boolean value) option as described [above](../02_getting_started/03_new_project.md#Create-a-new-project-interactively).

The configuration file must also specify an `output_dir` for the path in which to create the project directory. This path can be set to `~` for your home directory, or `.` for the current working directory.

Here is an example `config.yml`, which assumes that a directory named `~/code` already exists:

```yaml
output_dir: ~/code
project_name: Getting Started
repo_name: getting-started
python_package: getting_started
include_example: true
```

To create the new project:

```bash
kedro new --config config.yml
```
