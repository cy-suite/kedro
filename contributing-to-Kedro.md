## How to contribute

If you would like to help improve Kedro, here are some ways to contribute.

|Activity|Description|
|-|-|
|Community Q&A|We encourage you to ask and answer technical questions on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/discussions) or [Slack](https://slack.kedro.org/), but the former is often preferable since it will be picked up by search engines.|
|Report bugs and security vulnerabilities |We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues) to keep track of known bugs and security vulnerabilities. We keep a close eye on them and update them when we have an internal fix in progress. Before you report a new issue, do your best to ensure your problem hasn't already been reported. If it has, just leave a comment on the existing issue, rather than create a new one. <br /> If you have already checked the existing [GitHub issues](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues) and are still convinced that you have found odd or erroneous behaviour then please file a new one.|
|Propose a new feature|If you have new ideas for Kedro functionality then please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues) and describe the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.|
|Review pull requests|Check the [Kedro repo to find open pull requests](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/pulls) and contribute a review!|
|Contribute a fix or feature|If you're interested in contributing fixes to code or documentation, first read our [guidelines for contributing developers](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/contribution/developer_contributor_guidelines.html) for an explanation of how to get set up and the process you'll follow.  Once you are ready to contribute, a good place to start is to take a look at the `good first issues` and `help wanted issues` on [GitHub](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues).|
|Contribute to the documentation|You can help us improve the [Kedro documentation online](https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/). Send us feedback as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/issues) or start a documentation discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/discussions). You are also welcome to raise a PR with a bug fix or addition to the documentation. First read the guide [Contribute to the Kedro documentation](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro/wiki/Kedro-documentation-style-guide).

## Which contributions are likely to be accepted?

Dataset contributions to the [Kedro-Datasets](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-plugins/tree/main/kedro-datasets) plugin are the most frequently accepted, since they do not require any changes to the framework itself. However, we do not discourage contributions to any of the other [Kedro-Plugins](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-plugins).

Contributions based on existing issues from the Kedro team, or issues that the team has deemed useful, are likely to be accepted.

Any contributions that affect fundamental changes to the Kedro Framework would require discussion first. In this case, we recommend opening an issue instead of a pull request.

You can also make a contribution to [Awesome Kedro](https://github.com/kedro-org/awesome-kedro), our curated list of community content.
