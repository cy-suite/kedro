## Code of conduct

The Kedro team pledges to foster and maintain a friendly community. We enforce a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to ensure every Kedroid is welcomed and treated with respect.

## Join the community and help it grow!

You can find the Kedro community on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/akJDeVaxnB), which is where we share news and announcements, and general chat. You're also welcome to post links here to any articles or videos about Kedro that you create, or find, such as how-tos, showcases, demos, blog posts or tutorials.

We occasionally post on the [QuantumBlack blog](https://medium.com/quantumblack/) and we curate a [Github repo that lists content created by the Kedro community](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-community).

## Community Q&A

We encourage you to ask and answer technical questions on [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/discussions).

## Report a bug

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues) to keep track of known bugs. We keep a close eye on them and update them when we have an internal fix in progress.

Before you report a new issue, do your best to ensure your problem hasn't already been reported. If it has, just leave a comment on the existing issue, rather than create a new one. If you have already checked the existing [GitHub issues](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues) and are still convinced that you have found odd or erroneous behaviour then please file a new one.

## Propose a new feature
If you have new ideas for Kedro functionality then please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues) and describe the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.


## Review community pull requests

Check the [Kedro repo to find open pull requests](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/pulls) and contribute a review!

## Contribute a fix or feature

If you're interested in contributing fixes to code or documentation, first read our [guidelines for contributing developers](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/14_contribution/02_developer_contributor_guidelines.html) for an explanation of how to get set up and the process you'll follow.

Once you are ready to contribute, a good place to start is to take a look at the `good first issues` and `help wanted issues` on [GitHub](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues).

## Contribute to the documentation

You can help us improve the [Kedro documentation online](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Send us feedback as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues) or start a documentation discussion on [GitHub](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/discussions).

You are also welcome to make a raise a PR with a bug fix or addition to the documentation. First read the guide [Contribute to the Kedro documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/14_contribution/04_documentation_contributor_guidelines.html).
