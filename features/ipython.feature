Feature: IPython target in new project

  Scenario: Execute ipython target
    Given I have prepared a config file
    And I have run a non-interactive kedro new with starter
    When I execute the kedro command "ipython"
    Then I should get a message including "An enhanced Interactive Python"
    And I should get a message including "Kedro project project-dummy"
    And I should get a message including "Defined global variable 'context',"
    And I should get a message including "'session', 'catalog' and 'pipelines'"
