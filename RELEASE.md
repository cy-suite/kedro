# Upcoming Release

## Major features and improvements
* Added new CLI command `kedro catalog list`.
* Added support of Pandas 1.x.
* Enabled Python 3.8 compatibility. _Please note that a Spark workflow may be unreliable for this Python version as `pyspark` is not fully-compatible with 3.8 yet._
* Fixed `load_context` changing user's current working directory.
* Added the ability to specify nested parameter values inside your node inputs, e.g. `node(func, "params:a.b", None)`
* Improved error handling when making a typo on the command line. We now suggest some of the possible commands you meant to type, in `git`-style.
* Added the ability to specify extra arguments, e.g. `encoding` or `compression`, for `fsspec.spec.AbstractFileSystem.open()` calls when loading/saving a dataset. See Example 3 under [docs](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04_user_guide/04_data_catalog.html#using-the-data-catalog-with-the-yaml-api).
* Added an option to enable asynchronous loading inputs and saving outputs in both `SequentialRunner(is_asyc=True)` and `ParallelRunner(is_asyc=True)` class.
* Added the following datasets:
  - `GeoJSONDataSet`dataset in `kedro.extras.datasets.geopandas` for working with geospatial data that uses [`fsspec`](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to communicate with the underlying filesystem.
* Added instruction in the documentation on how to create a custom runner.

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Fixed a bug where a new version created mid-run by an external system caused inconsistencies in the load versions used in the current run.
* Documentation improvements.
* Updated contribution process in `CONTRIBUTING.md` - added Developer Workflow.
* Fixed a bug where `PartitionedDataSet` and `IncrementalDataSet` were not working with `s3a` or `s3n` protocol.
* Documented installation of development version of Kedro in the [FAQ section](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/06_resources/01_faq.html#how-can-i-use-development-version-of-kedro).
* Implemented custom glob function for `SparkDataSet` when running on Databricks.
* Added the option for contributors to run Kedro tests locally without Spark installation with `make test-no-spark`.

## Breaking changes to the API
* Made `invalidate_cache` method on datasets private.
* `get_last_load_version` and `get_last_save_version` methods are no longer available on `AbstractDataSet`.
* `get_last_load_version` and `get_last_save_version` have been renamed to `resolve_load_version` and `resolve_save_version` on ``AbstractVersionedDataSet``, the results of which are cached.
* The `release()` method on datasets extending ``AbstractVersionedDataSet`` clears the cached load and save version. All custom datasets must call `super()._release()` inside `_release()`.
* Removed `KEDRO_ENV_VAR` from `kedro.context` to speed up the CLI run time.
* Deleted obsoleted datasets from `kedro.io`.
* Deleted `kedro.contrib` and `extras` folders.
* `Pipeline.name` has been removed in favour of `Pipeline.tag()`.
* Python 3.5 is no longer supported by the current and all future versions of Kedro.
* ``TextDataSet`` no longer has `load_args` and `save_args`. These can instead be specified under `open_args_load` or `open_args_save` in `fs_args`.
* Dropped `Pipeline.transform()` in favour of `kedro.pipeline.modular_pipeline.pipeline()` helper function.
* Made constant `PARAMETER_KEYWORDS` private, and moved it from `kedro.pipeline.pipeline` to `kedro.pipeline.modular_pipeline`.

### Migration guide from Kedro 0.15.* to Upcoming Release
#### Migration for datasets

Since all the datasets (from `kedro.io` and `kedro.contrib.io`) were moved to `kedro/extras/datasets` you must update the type of all datasets in `<project>/conf/base/catalog.yml` file.
Here how it should be changed: `type: <SomeDataSet>` -> `type: <subfolder of kedro/extras/datasets>.<SomeDataSet>` (e.g. `type: CSVDataSet` -> `type: pandas.CSVDataSet`).

In addition, all the specific datasets like `CSVLocalDataSet`, `CSVS3DataSet` etc. were deprecated. Instead, you must use generalized datasets like `CSVDataSet`.
E.g. `type: CSVS3DataSet` -> `type: pandas.CSVDataSet`.

> Note: No changes required if you are using your custom dataset.

#### Migration for decorators, color logger, transformers etc.
Since some modules were moved to other locations you need to update import paths appropriately.
The list of moved files you can find in `0.15.6` release notes under `Files with a new location` section.

#### Migration for kedro env environment variable
> Note: If you haven't made significant changes to your `kedro_cli.py`, it may be easier to simply copy the updated `kedro_cli.py` `.ipython/profile_default/startup/00-kedro-init.py` and from GitHub or a newly generated project into your old project.

* We've removed `KEDRO_ENV_VAR` from `kedro.context`. To get your existing project template working, you'll need to remove all instances of `KEDRO_ENV_VAR` from your project template:
  - From the imports in `kedro_cli.py` and `.ipython/profile_default/startup/00-kedro-init.py`: `from kedro.context import KEDRO_ENV_VAR, load_context` -> `from kedro.context import load_context`
  - Remove the `envvar=KEDRO_ENV_VAR` line from the click options in `run`, `jupyter_notebook` and `jupyter_lab` in `kedro_cli.py`
  - Replace `KEDRO_ENV_VAR` with `"KEDRO_ENV"` in `_build_jupyter_env`
  - Replace `context = load_context(path, env=os.getenv(KEDRO_ENV_VAR))` with `context = load_context(path)` in `.ipython/profile_default/startup/00-kedro-init.py`

# 0.15.6

## Major features and improvements
> _TL;DR_ We're launching [`kedro.extras`](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/tree/master/extras), the new home for our revamped series of datasets, decorators and dataset transformers. The datasets in [`kedro.extras.datasets`](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/tree/master/extras/datasets) use [`fsspec`](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to access a variety of data stores including local file systems, network file systems, cloud object stores (including S3 and GCP), and Hadoop, read more about this [**here**](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/04_user_guide/04_data_catalog.html#specifying-the-location-of-the-dataset). The change will allow [#178](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro/issues/178) to happen in the next major release of Kedro.

An example of this new system can be seen below, loading the CSV `SparkDataSet` from S3:

```yaml
weather:
  type: spark.SparkDataSet  # Observe the specified type, this  affects all datasets
  filepath: s3a://your_bucket/data/01_raw/weather*  # filepath uses fsspec to indicate the file storage system
  credentials: dev_s3
  file_format: csv
```

You can also load data incrementally whenever it is dumped into a directory with the extension to [`PartionedDataSet`](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/04_user_guide/08_advanced_io.html#partitioned-dataset), a feature that allows you to load a directory of files. The [`IncrementalDataSet`](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04_user_guide/08_advanced_io.html#incremental-loads-with-incrementaldataset) stores the information about the last processed partition in a `checkpoint`, read more about this feature [**here**](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04_user_guide/08_advanced_io.html#incremental-loads-with-incrementaldataset).

### New features

* Added `layer` attribute for datasets in `kedro.extras.datasets` to specify the name of a layer according to [data engineering convention](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/06_resources/01_faq.html#what-is-data-engineering-convention), this feature will be passed to [`kedro-viz`](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-viz) in future releases.
* Enabled loading a particular version of a dataset in Jupyter Notebooks and iPython, using `catalog.load("dataset_name", version="<2019-12-13T15.08.09.255Z>")`.
* Added property `run_id` on `ProjectContext`, used for versioning using the [`Journal`](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/04_user_guide/13_journal.html). To customise your journal `run_id` you can override the private method `_get_run_id()`.
* Added the ability to install all optional kedro dependencies via `pip install "kedro[all]"`.
* Modified the `DataCatalog`'s load order for datasets, loading order is the following:
  - `kedro.io`
  - `kedro.extras.datasets`
  - Import path, specified in `type`
* Added an optional `copy_mode` flag to `CachedDataSet` and `MemoryDataSet` to specify (`deepcopy`, `copy` or `assign`) the copy mode to use when loading and saving.

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Added the option to set/overwrite params in `config.yaml` using YAML dict style instead of string CLI formatting only.
* Kedro CLI arguments `--node` and `--tag` support comma-separated values, alternative methods will be deprecated in future releases.
* Fixed a bug in the `invalidate_cache` method of `ParquetGCSDataSet` and `CSVGCSDataSet`.
* `--load-version` now won't break if version value contains a colon.
* Enabled running `node`s with duplicate inputs.
* Improved error message when empty credentials are passed into `SparkJDBCDataSet`.
* Fixed bug that caused an empty project to fail unexpectedly with ImportError in `template/.../pipeline.py`.
* Fixed bug related to saving dataframe with categorical variables in table mode using `HDFS3DataSet`.
* Fixed bug that caused unexpected behavior when using `from_nodes` and `to_nodes` in pipelines using transcoding.
* Credentials nested in the dataset config are now also resolved correctly.
* Bumped minimum required pandas version to 0.24.0 to make use of `pandas.DataFrame.to_numpy` (recommended alternative to `pandas.DataFrame.values`).
* Docs improvements.
* `Pipeline.transform` skips modifying node inputs/outputs containing `params:` or `parameters` keywords.
* Support for `dataset_credentials` key in the credentials for `PartitionedDataSet` is now deprecated. The dataset credentials should be specified explicitly inside the dataset config.
* Datasets can have a new `confirm` function which is called after a successful node function execution if the node contains `confirms` argument with such dataset name.
* Make the resume prompt on pipeline run failure use `--from-nodes` instead of `--from-inputs` to avoid unnecessarily re-running nodes that had already executed.
* When closed, Jupyter notebook kernels are automatically terminated after 30 seconds of inactivity by default. Use `--idle-timeout` option to update it.
* Added `kedro-viz` to the Kedro project template `requirements.txt` file.

# Release 0.15.5

## Major features and improvements
* New CLI commands and command flags:
  - Load multiple `kedro run` CLI flags from a configuration file with the `--config` flag (e.g. `kedro run --config run_config.yml`)
  - Run parametrised pipeline runs with the `--params` flag (e.g. `kedro run --params param1:value1,param2:value2`).
  - Lint your project code using the `kedro lint` command, your project is linted with [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) (Python 3.6+), [`flake8`](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) and [`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort).
* Load specific environments with Jupyter notebooks using `KEDRO_ENV` which will globally set `run`, `jupyter notebook` and `jupyter lab` commands using environment variables.
* Added the following datasets:
  - `CSVGCSDataSet` dataset in `contrib` for working with CSV files in Google Cloud Storage.
  - `ParquetGCSDataSet` dataset in `contrib` for working with Parquet files in Google Cloud Storage.
  - `JSONGCSDataSet` dataset in `contrib` for working with JSON files in Google Cloud Storage.
  - `MatplotlibS3Writer` dataset in `contrib` for saving Matplotlib images to S3.
  - `PartitionedDataSet` for working with datasets split across multiple files.
  - `JSONDataSet` dataset for working with JSON files that uses [`fsspec`](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to communicate with the underlying filesystem. It doesn't support `http(s)` protocol for now.
* Added `s3fs_args` to all S3 datasets.
* Pipelines can be deducted with `pipeline1 - pipeline2`.

## Bug fixes and other changes
* `ParallelRunner` now works with `SparkDataSet`.
* Allowed the use of nulls in `parameters.yml`.
* Fixed an issue where `%reload_kedro` wasn't reloading all user modules.
* Fixed `pandas_to_spark` and `spark_to_pandas` decorators to work with functions with kwargs.
* Fixed a bug where `kedro jupyter notebook` and `kedro jupyter lab` would run a different Jupyter installation to the one in the local environment.
* Implemented Databricks-compatible dataset versioning for `SparkDataSet`.
* Fixed a bug where `kedro package` would fail in certain situations where `kedro build-reqs` was used to generate `requirements.txt`.
* Made `bucket_name` argument optional for the following datasets: `CSVS3DataSet`, `HDFS3DataSet`, `PickleS3DataSet`, `contrib.io.parquet.ParquetS3DataSet`, `contrib.io.gcs.JSONGCSDataSet` - bucket name can now be included into the filepath along with the filesystem protocol (e.g. `s3://bucket-name/path/to/key.csv`).
* Documentation improvements and fixes.

## Breaking changes to the API
* Renamed entry point for running pip-installed projects to `run_package()` instead of `main()` in `src/<package>/run.py`.
* `bucket_name` key has been removed from the string representation of the following datasets: `CSVS3DataSet`, `HDFS3DataSet`, `PickleS3DataSet`, `contrib.io.parquet.ParquetS3DataSet`, `contrib.io.gcs.JSONGCSDataSet`.
* Moved the `mem_profiler` decorator to `contrib` and separated the `contrib` decorators so that dependencies are modular. You may need to update your import paths, for example the pyspark decorators should be imported as `from kedro.contrib.decorators.pyspark import <pyspark_decorator>` instead of `from kedro.contrib.decorators import <pyspark_decorator>`.

# Release 0.15.4

## Major features and improvements
* `kedro jupyter` now gives the default kernel a sensible name.
* `Pipeline.name` has been deprecated in favour of `Pipeline.tags`.
* Reuse pipelines within a Kedro project using `Pipeline.transform`, it simplifies dataset and node renaming.
* Added Jupyter Notebook line magic (`%run_viz`) to run `kedro viz` in a Notebook cell (requires [`kedro-viz`](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro-viz) version 3.0.0 or later).
* Added the following datasets:
  - `NetworkXLocalDataSet` in `kedro.contrib.io.networkx` to load and save local graphs (JSON format) via NetworkX. (by [@josephhaaga](https://github.com/josephhaaga))
  - `SparkHiveDataSet` in `kedro.contrib.io.pyspark.SparkHiveDataSet` allowing usage of Spark and insert/upsert on non-transactional Hive tables.
* `kedro.contrib.config.TemplatedConfigLoader` now supports name/dict key templating and default values.

## Bug fixes and other changes
* `get_last_load_version()` method for versioned datasets now returns exact last load version if the dataset has been loaded at least once and `None` otherwise.
* Fixed a bug in `_exists` method for versioned `SparkDataSet`.
* Enabled the customisation of the ExcelWriter in `ExcelLocalDataSet` by specifying options under `writer` key in `save_args`.
* Fixed a bug in IPython startup script, attempting to load context from the incorrect location.
* Removed capping the length of a dataset's string representation.
* Fixed `kedro install` command failing on Windows if `src/requirements.txt` contains a different version of Kedro.
* Enabled passing a single tag into a node or a pipeline without having to wrap it in a list (i.e. `tags="my_tag"`).

## Breaking changes to the API
* Removed `_check_paths_consistency()` method from `AbstractVersionedDataSet`. Version consistency check is now done in `AbstractVersionedDataSet.save()`. Custom versioned datasets should modify `save()` method implementation accordingly.

# Release 0.15.3

## Bug Fixes and other changes
* Narrowed the requirements for `PyTables` so that we maintain support for Python 3.5.

# Release 0.15.2

## Major features and improvements
* Added `--load-version`, a `kedro run` argument that allows you run the pipeline with a particular load version of a dataset.
* Support for modular pipelines in `src/`, break the pipeline into isolated parts with reusability in mind.
* Support for multiple pipelines, an ability to have multiple entry point pipelines and choose one with `kedro run --pipeline NAME`.
* Added a `MatplotlibWriter` dataset in `contrib` for saving Matplotlib images.
* An ability to template/parameterize configuration files with `kedro.contrib.config.TemplatedConfigLoader`.
* Parameters are exposed as a context property for ease of access in iPython / Jupyter Notebooks with `context.params`.
* Added `max_workers` parameter for ``ParallelRunner``.

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Users will override the `_get_pipeline` abstract method in `ProjectContext(KedroContext)` in `run.py` rather than the `pipeline` abstract property. The `pipeline` property is not abstract anymore.
* Improved an error message when versioned local dataset is saved and unversioned path already exists.
* Added `catalog` global variable to `00-kedro-init.py`, allowing you to load datasets with `catalog.load()`.
* Enabled tuples to be returned from a node.
* Disallowed the ``ConfigLoader`` loading the same file more than once, and deduplicated the `conf_paths` passed in.
* Added a `--open` flag to `kedro build-docs` that opens the documentation on build.
* Updated the ``Pipeline`` representation to include name of the pipeline, also making it readable as a context property.
* `kedro.contrib.io.pyspark.SparkDataSet` and `kedro.contrib.io.azure.CSVBlobDataSet` now support versioning.

## Breaking changes to the API
* `KedroContext.run()` no longer accepts `catalog` and `pipeline` arguments.
* `node.inputs` now returns the node's inputs in the order required to bind them properly to the node's function.

# Release 0.15.1

## Major features and improvements
* Extended `versioning` support to cover the tracking of environment setup, code and datasets.
* Added the following datasets:
  - `FeatherLocalDataSet` in `contrib` for usage with pandas. (by [@mdomarsaleem](https://github.com/mdomarsaleem))
* Added `get_last_load_version` and `get_last_save_version` to `AbstractVersionedDataSet`.
* Implemented `__call__` method on `Node` to allow for users to execute `my_node(input1=1, input2=2)` as an alternative to `my_node.run(dict(input1=1, input2=2))`.
* Added new `--from-inputs` run argument.

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Fixed a bug in `load_context()` not loading context in non-Kedro Jupyter Notebooks.
* Fixed a bug in `ConfigLoader.get()` not listing nested files for `**`-ending glob patterns.
* Fixed a logging config error in Jupyter Notebook.
* Updated documentation in `03_configuration` regarding how to modify the configuration path.
* Documented the architecture of Kedro showing how we think about library, project and framework components.
* `extras/kedro_project_loader.py` renamed to `extras/ipython_loader.py` and now runs any IPython startup scripts without relying on the Kedro project structure.
* Fixed TypeError when validating partial function's signature.
* After a node failure during a pipeline run, a resume command will be suggested in the logs. This command will not work if the required inputs are MemoryDataSets.

# Release 0.15.0

## Major features and improvements
* Added `KedroContext` base class which holds the configuration and Kedro's main functionality (catalog, pipeline, config, runner).
* Added a new CLI command `kedro jupyter convert` to facilitate converting Jupyter Notebook cells into Kedro nodes.
* Added support for `pip-compile` and new Kedro command `kedro build-reqs` that generates `requirements.txt` based on `requirements.in`.
* Running `kedro install` will install packages to conda environment if `src/environment.yml` exists in your project.
* Added a new `--node` flag to `kedro run`, allowing users to run only the nodes with the specified names.
* Added new `--from-nodes` and `--to-nodes` run arguments, allowing users to run a range of nodes from the pipeline.
* Added prefix `params:` to the parameters specified in `parameters.yml` which allows users to differentiate between their different parameter node inputs and outputs.
* Jupyter Lab/Notebook now starts with only one kernel by default.
* Added the following datasets:
  -  `CSVHTTPDataSet` to load CSV using HTTP(s) links.
  - `JSONBlobDataSet` to load json (-delimited) files from Azure Blob Storage.
  - `ParquetS3DataSet` in `contrib` for usage with pandas. (by [@mmchougule](https://github.com/mmchougule))
  - `CachedDataSet` in `contrib` which will cache data in memory to avoid io/network operations. It will clear the cache once a dataset is no longer needed by a pipeline. (by [@tsanikgr](https://github.com/tsanikgr))
  - `YAMLLocalDataSet` in `contrib` to load and save local YAML files. (by [@Minyus](https://github.com/Minyus))

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Documentation improvements including instructions on how to initialise a Spark session using YAML configuration.
* `anyconfig` default log level changed from `INFO` to `WARNING`.
* Added information on installed plugins to `kedro info`.
* Added style sheets for project documentation, so the output of `kedro build-docs` will resemble the style of `kedro docs`.

## Breaking changes to the API
* Simplified the Kedro template in `run.py` with the introduction of `KedroContext` class.
* Merged `FilepathVersionMixIn` and `S3VersionMixIn` under one abstract class `AbstractVersionedDataSet` which extends`AbstractDataSet`.
* `name` changed to be a keyword-only argument for `Pipeline`.
* `CSVLocalDataSet` no longer supports URLs. `CSVHTTPDataSet` supports URLs.

### Migration guide from Kedro 0.14.* to Kedro 0.15.0
#### Migration for Kedro project template
This guide assumes that:
  * The framework specific code has not been altered significantly
  * Your project specific code is stored in the dedicated python package under `src/`.

The breaking changes were introduced in the following project template files:
- `<project-name>/.ipython/profile_default/startup/00-kedro-init.py`
- `<project-name>/kedro_cli.py`
- `<project-name>/src/tests/test_run.py`
- `<project-name>/src/<package-name>/run.py`
- `<project-name>/.kedro.yml` (new file)

The easiest way to migrate your project from Kedro 0.14.* to Kedro 0.15.0 is to create a new project (by using `kedro new`) and move code and files bit by bit as suggested in the detailed guide below:

1. Create a new project with the same name by running `kedro new`

2. Copy the following folders to the new project:
 - `results/`
 - `references/`
 - `notebooks/`
 - `logs/`
 - `data/`
 - `conf/`

3. If you customised your `src/<package>/run.py`, make sure you apply the same customisations to `src/<package>/run.py`
 - If you customised `get_config()`, you can override `config_loader` property in `ProjectContext` derived class
 - If you customised `create_catalog()`, you can override `catalog()` property in `ProjectContext` derived class
 - If you customised `run()`, you can override `run()` method in `ProjectContext` derived class
 - If you customised default `env`, you can override it in `ProjectContext` derived class or pass it at construction. By default, `env` is `local`.
 - If you customised default `root_conf`, you can override `CONF_ROOT` attribute in `ProjectContext` derived class. By default, `KedroContext` base class has `CONF_ROOT` attribute set to `conf`.

4. The following syntax changes are introduced in ipython or Jupyter notebook/labs:
 - `proj_dir` -> `context.project_path`
 - `proj_name` -> `context.project_name`
 - `conf` -> `context.config_loader`.
 - `io` -> `context.catalog` (e.g., `io.load()` -> `context.catalog.load()`)

5. If you customised your `kedro_cli.py`, you need to apply the same customisations to your `kedro_cli.py` in the new project.

6. Copy the contents of the old project's `src/requirements.txt` into the new project's `src/requirements.in` and, from the project root directory, run the `kedro build-reqs` command in your terminal window.

#### Migration for versioning custom dataset classes

If you defined any custom dataset classes which support versioning in your project, you need to apply the following changes:

1. Make sure your dataset inherits from `AbstractVersionedDataSet` only.
2. Call `super().__init__()` with the appropriate arguments in the dataset's `__init__`. If storing on local filesystem, providing the filepath and the version is enough. Otherwise, you should also pass in an `exists_function` and a `glob_function` that emulate `exists` and `glob` in a different filesystem (see `CSVS3DataSet` as an example).
3. Remove setting of the `_filepath` and `_version` attributes in the dataset's `__init__`, as this is taken care of in the base abstract class.
4. Any calls to `_get_load_path` and `_get_save_path` methods should take no arguments.
5. Ensure you convert the output of `_get_load_path` and `_get_save_path` appropriately, as these now return [`PurePath`s](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pure-paths) instead of strings.
6. Make sure `_check_paths_consistency` is called with [`PurePath`s](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pure-paths) as input arguments, instead of strings.

These steps should have brought your project to Kedro 0.15.0. There might be some more minor tweaks needed as every project is unique, but now you have a pretty solid base to work with. If you run into any problems, please consult the [Kedro documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io).

# Release 0.14.3

## Major features and improvements
* Tab completion for catalog datasets in `ipython` or `jupyter` sessions. (Thank you [@datajoely](https://github.com/datajoely) and [@WaylonWalker](https://github.com/WaylonWalker))
* Added support for transcoding, an ability to decouple loading/saving mechanisms of a dataset from its storage location, denoted by adding '@' to the dataset name.
* Datasets have a new `release` function that instructs them to free any cached data. The runners will call this when the dataset is no longer needed downstream.

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Add support for pipeline nodes made up from partial functions.
* Expand user home directory `~` for TextLocalDataSet (see issue #19).
* Add a `short_name` property to `Node`s for a display-friendly (but not necessarily unique) name.
* Add Kedro project loader for IPython: `extras/kedro_project_loader.py`.
* Fix source file encoding issues with Python 3.5 on Windows.
* Fix local project source not having priority over the same source installed as a package, leading to local updates not being recognised.

## Breaking changes to the API
* Remove the max_loads argument from the `MemoryDataSet` constructor and from the `AbstractRunner.create_default_data_set` method.

# Release 0.14.2

## Major features and improvements
* Added Data Set transformer support in the form of AbstractTransformer and DataCatalog.add_transformer.

## Breaking changes to the API
* Merged the `ExistsMixin` into `AbstractDataSet`.
* `Pipeline.node_dependencies` returns a dictionary keyed by node, with sets of parent nodes as values; `Pipeline` and `ParallelRunner` were refactored to make use of this for topological sort for node dependency resolution and running pipelines respectively.
* `Pipeline.grouped_nodes` returns a list of sets, rather than a list of lists.
