# Release 0.14.3

## Major features and improvements
* Tab completion for catalog datasets in `ipython` or `jupyter` sessions.
* Added support for transcoding, an ability to decouple loading/saving mechanisms of a dataset from its storage location. It is denoted by adding '@' to the dataset name. This will allow you to read the same dataset or file in two different ways.

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Add support for pipeline nodes made up from partial functions

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Expand user home directory (~) for TextLocalDataSet (see issue #19)

## Breaking changes to the API

## Bug fixes and other changes
* Added Kedro project loader for IPython: `extras/kedro_project_loader.py`.

# Release 0.14.2

## Major features and improvements
* Added Data Set transformer support in the form of AbstractTransformer and DataCatalog.add_transformer.

## Breaking changes to the API
* Merged the `ExistsMixin` into `AbstractDataSet`.
* `Pipeline.node_dependencies` returns a dictionary keyed by node, with sets of parent nodes as values; `Pipeline` and `ParallelRunner` were refactored to make use of this for topological sort for node dependency resolution and running pipelines respectively.
* `Pipeline.grouped_nodes` returns a list of sets, rather than a list of lists.
