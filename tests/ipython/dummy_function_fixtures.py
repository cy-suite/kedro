This file serves as a fixture for the %load_node test_ipython.py in the testing suites.
It contains variations of import statements for testing purposes. The usage of the
`logging` library as a dummy library is intentional, as it is part of the standard
libraries, but it can be replaced with any other library for further testing scenarios.
